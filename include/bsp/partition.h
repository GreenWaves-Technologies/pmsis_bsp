/**
 * @defgroup Partition Partition
 *
 * The partition driver provides support for handling partition
 * contained into a device storage.
 * Currently, PMSIS and GAP SDK provide both partitions, binary firmware and filesystem.
 *
 * - 0 -> Binary firmware;
 * - 1 -> Filesystem or Free space.
 *
 * The beginning  of the filesystem partition is aligned on a flash sector.
 * Thus, an erase partition operation at address zero does not affect the data of the previous partition.
